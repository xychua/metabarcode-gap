This folder contains the scripts that generates the figures found in the manuscript.

Due to the extremely large number (and size) of the full pairwise alignments
in some of the primer pairs, only a subset of the alignments specific to each
case study is shared. 

Descriptions of the data generation and code for data processing is provided in
their relevant folder that describe the whole process.
